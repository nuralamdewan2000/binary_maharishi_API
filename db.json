Do people lead with integrity in the same ways that 'integrity' is supposed to mean or is there an entirely different way integrity is embodied? Even still, as this person seemed to think, is there some sort of integrity decline going on?It’s believed that integrity means that you’re the same in person as you are in private. I haven't heard a definition of integrity that's so all-encompassing and holistic, though I suppose that's exactly what having integrity must mean. The description also pulls in a sense of 'soundness' or 'completeness' in the individual, place, or thing that holds integrity. ‘Completeness’ probably confounds me the most since, I believe, most people juggle so many different public and private personas in all aspects of one’s life that it seems hard that a sense of unity in character can ever be forged.",

    "description": "some of my favorite things to consider in UX are above and beyond the reach of the website or application I’m designing. I’m intensely interested in studying people's behavior as they navigate multiple platforms, touchpoints, and interactions with everything in their lives. We traditionally call this CX (customer experience), but I’d like to propose that as the digital and commercial worlds converge more with our natural world, it’s now just our human experience (HX).",
